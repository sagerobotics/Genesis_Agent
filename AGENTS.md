# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `Genesis.mjs` contains the primary agent setup and example request flow.
- `example.mjs` is a minimal usage sample for the OpenAI Responses API.
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json` define Node.js dependencies.
- `node_modules/` is generated by npm and should not be edited manually.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm install` installs dependencies listed in `package.json`.
- `node Genesis.mjs` runs the main agent example.
- `node example.mjs` runs the minimal API call sample.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use ESM (`.mjs`) with `import`/`export` syntax.
- Prefer 2-space indentation and semicolons, matching existing files.
- Use camelCase for variables and PascalCase for classes (e.g., `agent`, `OpenAI`).
- Keep single-file examples small and focused; avoid unused imports.

## Testing Guidelines
- No test framework is configured in this repository.
- If adding tests, document the runner and naming convention (for example, `*.test.mjs`) and update the commands section.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit history uses short, sentence-case messages (e.g., `First commit`). Keep messages concise and descriptive.
- PRs should include a brief summary, the reason for the change, and how to run or verify it.
- Do not commit secrets; use environment variables such as `OPENAI_API_KEY` for local runs.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your shell before running examples.
- Avoid hard-coding keys or model credentials in source files.
